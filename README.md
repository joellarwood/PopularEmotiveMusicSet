# The Popular Music Emotion Set 

## Rationale 
Validated stimuli sets are vital for affect and emotion research. This can be seen through sets of vocal stimuli (i.e. [The RAVDESS][1]), images (i.e. [OASIS][2]) and for instrumental music ( the [Jyvaskylla set][3]). However, no validated set exists featuring contemporary, popular, music. An affective set of popular music would be of particular use to researchers, given it is more representative of daily musical, and therefore emotional, engagement. 

The set will be developed using the [`spotifyR`][4] package for R to harvest song data from the top 200 songs of triple j's hottest 100 from 2016-2018 (representing over 7.5 million votes).
