Here we use data from the 1000songs dataset to evaluate valence and arousal ratings for felt emotion in music. We relate this information to data provided by the spotify API gathered with the spotifyr package. To do this we will create a playlist of the songs and relate the spotify provided characteristics to the Mturk worker provided annotations provided characteristics. This will serve to validate the spotify ratings before moving on to collect data from participants where we specifically ask for songs that make them feel certain ways in terms of affect.
